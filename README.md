# Thermostat

This app models a simple thermostat

The user stories for this project are 

```
As a user
So that I know how warm it is
I want to be able to see the current temperature

As a user
So that I can be warmer
I would like to be able to increase the temperature

As a user
So that I can be cooler
I would like to be able to decrease the temperature
```

The thermostat has a minimum and maximum temperature and also has a power saving mode, which limits the maximum temperature.

The thermostat can be interacted with by opening the index.html file in the project root in a browser window.
